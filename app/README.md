# **app**

## **Overview**

Even though there were many wonderful web frameworks like [lor](https://github.com/sumory/lor) which was fast and minimalist based on [OpenResty](https://github.com/openresty/openresty), but i still plan to build a more minimalist web framework that refer to lor.

The biggest difference from lor is the [**static route**]().

## **Useage**

## **TODO**

1. this component will finish initialization in int_worker_by_lua stage instead of triggering initialization by first user request like in lor.
